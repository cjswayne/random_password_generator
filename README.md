# random_password_generator

## Description
In this project I refactored code that was given to me. The purpose of the project is to refactor the the code given to generate a random password based on a set of criterion. I updated the form to include inputs for password length, lowercase characters, uppercase characters, special characters and numbers. I also wrote javascript functions to take those inputs and create a random password based off of those inputs when the user presses the "Generate Password" button.
